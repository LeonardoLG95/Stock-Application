that are part of the SP500, Nasdaq100, DOW, ETH and BTC.

To use this application you need to have Docker 
installed and know the basics.

Also you need to create inside `puller/drivers/finhub` a file called `finnhub_token.py`,
this file should contain the constant for your token from Finnhub as follow:

```python
API_TOKEN = '&token=YOUR-TOKEN-STRING'

```

## Deploy ðŸ“¦

You can run the `script.py` to just populate the database or use the `service.py` as a service for refresh the data every certain amount of time.

also pull some information of the business as the industry, the full name, ipo, etc
