# Stock looker
An application to pull information of the stocks of the companies 
that are part of the SP500, Nasdaq100, DOW, ETH and BTC.

# Wallet administrator
An application to register your operations and see the evolution of your wallet.

### Pre-requisites ðŸ“‹
To use this application you need to have Docker 
installed and know the basics.

Also, you need to create inside `puller/drivers/finhub` a file called `finnhub_token.py`,
this file should contain the constant for your token from Finnhub as follows:

```python
API_TOKEN = '&token=YOUR-TOKEN-STRING'

```

## Deploy ðŸ“¦
Before deploy, you have the option to uncomment the line `# ENTRYPOINT python3 script.py` 
and comment the line `ENTRYPOINT python3 service.py` in the Docker file, to run the puller just once.

After that, run the following command inside `puller/`:
```bash
docker build . -t finhub_puller:finhub_puller
```

And then, run the docker-compose file after run the superset docker project, or change the network configuration in the docker-compose file.

## Limitations 
This program is thought for the free version of Finnhub API, if you desire to use it with a premium account you should change the line 17 from `self._semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(60)` to `self._semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(1000)` in `puller/puller.py` 

## Info ðŸ“–
For now, the program `pull information of prices and MACd` in the intervals of day, week and month, 
also pull some information of the business as the industry, the full name, ipo, etc

As you will see in the docker-compose file, 
this project is compatible with the docker superset project.

Here is an example representing the data this project can pull:

![superset1](./superset1.png)

![superset2](./superset2.png)

Also, the port of the database is exposed in the docker-compose file 
to access to the database from an external client.
